<h3>Li-F : A new paradigm in wireless communication</h3>
 <p class="text-justify">"At the heart of this technology is a new generation of high-brightness light-emitting diode." says Harald Haas from the University Of Edinburgh, UK. "Very simply, if the LED is on, you transmit a digital 1, if it's off you transmit a 0.", says Hass, who coined the term Li-Fi. "They can be switched on and off very quickly, which gives nice opportunities for transmitting data.‚ÄùWi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity), which uses 2.4-5GHz RF to deliver wireless Internet access has its limitations as it
 covers an entire house, its bandwidth is typically limited to 50-100 megabits per second (Mbps) today using the IEEE802.11n standard which is a good match to the speed of most current Internet services, but insufficient for moving large data files like HDTV movies, music libraries and video games.
The more we become dependent upon "the cloud" or our own "media servers" to store all of our files, including movies, music, pictures and games, the more we will want bandwidth and speed. Therefore RF-based technologies such as todays Wi-Fi are not the optimal way. In addition, Wi-Fi may not be the most efficient way to provide new desired capabilities such as precision indoor positioning and gesture recognition.
Optical wireless technologies, sometimes called visible light communication (VLC), and more recently referred to as Li-Fi (Light Fidelity), on the other hand, offer an entirely new paradigm in wireless technologies in terms of communication speed, flexibility and usability.
Visible light communication (VLC) offers optical wireless communication by using visible light which is seen as an alternative to different RF-based communication services in wireless personal are networks. And so LED lighting can be used for illumination and communication at the same time with the same module. In contrast to infrared, the so-called "what you see is what you send" feature can be used to improve the usability of transmitting data at shorter point-to-point distances between different portable or fixed devices. There, illumination can be used for beam guiding, discovery or generating an alarm for misalignment. One of the biggest attractions of VLC is the energy saving of LED technology.  The VLC Consortium (VLCC) in Japan was one of the first to introduce this technology. The final standard approved in 2011 specifies VLC comprising mobile-to-mobile (M2M), fixed-to-mobile (F2M) and infrastructure-to-mobile (I2M) communications. There, the focus is on low-speed, medium-range communications for intelligent traffic systems and on high-speed, short range M2M and F2M communications to exchange, for example, multimedia data. Data rates are supported from some 100 kbps up to 100 Mbps using different modulation schemes.
VLC represents only a fraction of what appears to be a much larger movement towards optical wireless technologies in general. This larger world has been dubbed "Li-Fi"(Light Fidelity) by people such as Dr Harald Haas of Edinburgh University and organizations such as the Li-Fi Consortium. Li-Fi refers to wireless communication systems using light as a medium instead of traditional radio frequencies, as in technology using the trademark Wi-Fi. It has the advantage of being able to be used in electromagnetic sensitive areas such as in aircraft or nuclear power plants, without causing interference. However, the light waves used cannot penetrate the walls due to which Li-Fi more secure relative to Wi-Fi. Li-Fi comprises a wide range of frequencies and wavelengths, from the infrared through visible and down to the ultraviolet spectrum. It includes sub-gigabit and gigabit-class communication speeds for short, medium and long ranges, and unidirectional and bidirectional data transfer using line-of-sight or diffuse links, reflections and much more. It is not limited to LED or laser technologies or to a particular receiving technique. Li-Fi is a framework for all of these providing new capabilities to current and future services, applications and end users.
Imagine yourself walking into a mall where the GPS signals are unavailable but the mall is equipped with ceiling bulbs that create their own "constellation" of navigation beacons. As the camera of your cell phone, automatically receives these signals, it switches your navigation software to use this information to guide you to the ATM machine you are looking for.  You conclude your ATM transaction and notice the Giga Spot sign for instant digital movie downloads. You pick out that new Tom Cruise movie using your phone's payment facility, and then download within a few seconds the high-definition movie into the Giga Link flash drive plugged into the USB port of your smart phone.
As you walk away, your phone notifies you that the leather jacket Tom featured in the movie is on sale nearby. You walk over towards the show window and your image comes up on the screen, wearing that coveted jacket. You turn and pose while the image matches your orientation and body gestures for a "digital fitting".When you walk into the store, the clerk hands you the actual jacket in exactly your size. And this is how Li-Fi works.
First applications of Li-Fi have been put to use already, for example, in hospitals where RF signals are a threat due to interference problems with medical equipment such as blood pumps and other life supporting instruments. Axiomatic Europe presented such a product at the Embedded World exhibition in Nurnberg, Germany. The prototype of a mobile phone with an incorporated VLC system was presented by Casio at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2012. In the coming years, we will see more Li-Fi products entering the market, both in the industrial as well as consumer markets.
Lighting reaches nearly everywhere, so communication can ride along for nearly free. Think of a TV remote in every LED light bulb and you'll soon realize the possibilities of communication using visible light-also dubbed as Li-Fi.
